🏥 Healthcare KPI Analysis – Lowell General Hospital

📌 Problem Statement

Lowell General Hospital sought to improve patient safety and satisfaction by tracking critical KPIs, but leadership lacked structured insights into trends and correlations. Key challenges included:

Unclear relationship between bed occupancy, staff responsiveness, and patient falls.

Difficulty comparing performance against benchmarks.

Limited ability to quantify the impact of interventions on resource allocation.

🎯 Objective

Systematically analyze KPIs to identify trends, anomalies, and correlations.

Benchmark performance against industry standards.

Recommend data-driven strategies for improving patient safety and staff efficiency.

🛠 Methodology

1. Data Preparation

Extracted and processed 20+ years of hospital data (2000–2024).

Cleaned missing/duplicate records, standardized KPIs to percentages.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Used boxplots and time-series charts to detect anomalies.

Compared against benchmarks (e.g., responsiveness ≥ 65%).

3. Correlation & Trend Analysis

Calculated Pearson correlation to explore relationships:

Found −0.79 correlation between staff responsiveness and fall rate.

Analyzed occupancy trends (~97% average) and identified strain points.

4. Impact

Staff Responsiveness: Improved by 6% post resource reallocation.

Resource Efficiency: +10% increase in months where occupancy was within optimal range.

Benchmark Alignment: Measured % of periods meeting/exceeding targets.

5. Visualization & Reporting

Designed Power BI dashboards for leadership to track trends.

Delivered actionable reports highlighting where interventions were most impactful.

📈 Results

Enabled 10% more efficient resource allocation.

Improved staff responsiveness by 6%, directly reducing fall risk.

Established a continuous monitoring framework to sustain improvements.
